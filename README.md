1. I learned naive Bayes classifiers up till this point<br>
  * prac1 is a **SMS** filter, using data from github<br>
  * ust_email.CSV is the raw email content from my inbox export, ust_data.csv is the cleaned data but not labelled<br>
  * the two **.pkl** file one is the vectorizer and the other is the trained sms spam filter model, **spam-use.py** has detail about how to use them
